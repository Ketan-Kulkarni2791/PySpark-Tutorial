****** STRUCTURED API - DATAFRAMES ******

-- Dataframes is the most common structured API, represented like a table.
-- The table is represented in the form of rows and columns.
-- DataFrame has a schema, which is the metadata for the columns i.e each column will 
   have its own metadata.
-- Data in DataFrames are stored in partitions.
-- DataFrames are immutable.

****** WHAT IS PARTITION ? ******

-- To allow every executers to work in parallel, spark breaks down the data into chunks called 'partition'.

****** WHAT ARE TRANSFORMATIONS ? ******

-- The instruction or code to modify and transform data is known as 'Transformation'.
-- For example - select, where, groupby etc
-- Transformation helps spark to build the logical plan.
-- There are two types of Transformations :
    1. Narrow Transformation
    2. Wide Transformation

>>>> See the image : G:\PySpark Tutorial\Notes\images\spark_transformations_example.jpg

1. Narrow Transformation : After applying Transformation, each partition contributes to at-most one partition.
2. Wide Transformation : After applying transformation, if one partition contributes to more than one partition.
                         This type of transformation leads to data shuffle.

****** WHAT ARE ACTIONS ? ******

-- To trigger the execution, we need to call an Action.
-- This basically executes the plan created by Transformation.
-- Actions are of 3 types :

    1. View data in console
    2. Collect data to native languages
    3. Write data to output data sources

****** SPARK PREFERS LAZY EVALUATION *****

-- Spark will wait till last moment to execute the graph of computation.
-- This allows spark to optimize, plan and use the resources properly for the exexution.


****** WHAT IS SPARK SESSION ? ******

-- Driver process is known as "Spark Session".
-- It is the entry point for a spark execution.
-- The Spark Session instance executes the code in the cluster.
-- And the relation is one-to-one i.e. For one spark application we will have one spark
   session instance.
